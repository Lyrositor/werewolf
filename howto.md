Welcome to the game of Werewolf, where the goal is to discover who has lycanthropic tendencies, who is lying, and who is trying to save the world!

Werewolf is played with a minimum of 4 players, with a maximum of about 20 on our bot (any more and there's just too much lag as it tries to do things).  When the game starts, you are assigned a random [role]({{ site.baseurl }}/roles). Depending on this role, you will have different goals. In addition, there are various gameplay modes that have a different number of roles (including some unique roles). In general, these roles can be broken down into the following three teams.

#### Villager Team

The goal of the Villager team is to find all of the wolves before the wolves overpower the village. Some have special powers, some do not.

#### Wolf Team

The Werewolves are trying to kill everyone who is not them, or help the wolves kill everyone. Most of the Wolf team roles have a special ability.

#### Neutrals

The Neutral roles either have independent goals, or else may become a part of another team and win with that team depending upon certain conditions.
