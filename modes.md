#### Evilvillage

In evilvillage, the wolf team has higher chances of success. The default role is **Cultist** instead of Villager.

In random, the roles are randomly assigned and are hidden. This can be a very hard mode to play, mainly because no one knows how many of what role there are. All roles are available.
