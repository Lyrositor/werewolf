## Channel rules
1. Use common sense.
1. Be nice to each other. No bigotry. Seriously, don't rage at each other.
1. No explicit sexual discussion or links to NSFW images.
1. Unauthorized bots, public logging and/or related activities are not permitted.
1. Automated messages to the channel, including but not limited to anti-idle scripts, away notifications and similar, are not allowed.
1. Don't spam. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Manually highlighting people.
  - Spamming and/or abusing !start or other bot commands.
  - Posting text longer than 3 lines. Use a pastebin like [privatepaste.com](https://www.privatepaste.com).
  - Posting ASCII art. If you really have to, use a pastebin or link to a picture.
  - Posting garbage or other worthless messages.
  - Excessive shouting (CAPS LOCK). It's equally bad if your Shift key is hanging.
  - Abusing colours. We will disable colours if this gets out of hand.
1. Don't advertise other channels.
1. Ops' decisions are final. If you want to discuss your issue in a civilized manner, please query Olorin.
1. If you are not in the game, please remain quiet and don't influence a game in progress. The bot enforces moderation on the channel, however we do have a lot of players with elevated access (ops).

## Gameplay rules
1. Use common sense.
1. Talking during the night phase is highly discouraged. Don't do it unless you have to.
1. Participation is required during the day phase. This is a social game. If you're not talking, you're not playing. For the sake of everyone's enjoyment, please participate!
1. Try to refrain from making decisions based on what a player was in a previous game. Every game is unique! (With that being said, some people just play the same way every game.)
1. Players may not share information or be involved in gameplay-related communications after dying (including dead vengeful ghosts).
1. Don't play with clones; only one player per actual person is allowed. Any player found to be using clones will immediately be banned from the game.
1. Do not paste gameplay-related messages that came from outside of #werewolf (such as from a private message, safe channel, or wolf chat) during the game, except in the following circumstances:
  - Pasting messages into wolf chat is allowed.
  - Pasting the wolf list is allowed.
1. Don't fake gameplay messages from the bot.
1. Don't make tedious hints. Hashing/encoding hints and messing with colors can be uncreative and boring. If asked to stop doing it, stop and find a more fun way of hinting.
1. Don't !quit or !leave after a game has started unless you really need to leave.
1. Automatic sharing of game-related information, including but not limited to automated messages to the bot or other players, is not permitted.
1. Waiting for timeouts is discouraged.
1. Ops' decisions are final. If you want to discuss your issue in a civilized manner, please query Olorin.
