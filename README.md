# Werewolf
## the unofficial docs site for [Lykos](https://github.com/lykoss/lykos) found at (http://werewolf.drunknerds.net/)

This is a Jekyll site, currently running on a very slightly modified default theme with the blog listing functionality removed from `index.html`.

To run the site locally for development, run `jekyll s` in a console. This will open a small webserver on `127.0.0.1:4000` and will regenerate \_site whenever a file is created/modified/deleted (with the exception of \_config.yml).

When ready to add to the site, please let @laneatomic (tacocat in IRC) know!
